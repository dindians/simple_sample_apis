In Spring 5, Spring gained a reactive web framework: Spring WebFlux.
This is designed to co-exist alongside the existing Spring Web MVC APIs, but to add support for non-blocking designs.
Using WebFlux, you can build asynchronous web applications, using reactive streams and functional APIs to better support concurrency and scaling.
